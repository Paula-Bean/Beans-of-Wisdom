# Loading composer repositories with package information
# Installing dependencies (including require-dev) from lock file
# Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.
# Problem 1
#    - Installation request for phpspec/phpspec 5.0.3 -> satisfiable by phpspec/phpspec[5.0.3].
#   - phpspec/phpspec 5.0.3 requires php ^7.1, <7.3 -> your PHP version (7.3.5) does not satisfy that requirement.

# composer update
# ....
# Package phpoffice/phpexcel is abandoned, you should avoid using it. Use phpoffice/phpspreadsheet instead.
